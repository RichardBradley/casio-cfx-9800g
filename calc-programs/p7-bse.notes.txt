This is a (somewhat dark) simulator where you play a cow culling business during the BSE cull days.
Each game turn is one week (or one year, depending on which prompt you read!).
The vars are:
    S = money
    C = live cows
    F = income per week
    G = government happyness as a range from 0 - 1
    K = abatoir spaces (how many cows you may kill per week)
    B = barn spaces

Each live cow costs £5 per week to feed (qq barn space?)
It costs £5 to kill a cow, and you must have an abatoir space to do so.
It costs £5 to buy an abatoir space.
It costs £1 to buy a barn space.

You start each turn by receiving 25-100 new cows.

At the end of each turn, if you have more cows than barn spaces, the government becomes unhappy by 0.5% per unhoused cow (and becomes happy if you have empty barn space, although that probably wasn't deliberate).

After each turn, your income increases or decreases by £1 for each % the government is more or less than 50% happy.

You lose if you end up with < £-100

You win if you mange to kill at least 1000 cows and can end a turn with zero live cows.
